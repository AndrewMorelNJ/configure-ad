Setup Domain Controller in Azure

Create a Resource Group
Create a Virtual Network and Subnet
Create the Domain Controller VM (Windows Server 2022) named “DC-1”
Username: labuser
Password: Cyberlab123!
After VM is created, set Domain Controller’s NIC Private IP address to be static
Log into the VM and disable the Windows Firewall (for testing connectivity)

Setup Client-1 in Azure

Create the Client VM (Windows 10) named “Client-1”
Username: labuser
Password: Cyberlab123!
Attach it to the same region and Virtual Network as DC-1
After VM is created, set Client-1’s DNS settings to DC-1’s Private IP address
From the Azure Portal, restart Client-1
Login to Client-1
Attempt to ping DC-1’s private IP address
Ensure the ping succeeded
From Client-1, open PowerShell and run ipconfig /all
The output for the DNS settings should show DC-1’s private IP Address
